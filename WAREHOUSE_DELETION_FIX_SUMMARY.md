# Warehouse Deletion Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The warehouse deletion logic was failing with the error: `operator does not exist: uuid = text` when trying to delete warehouses. This was occurring because the SQL queries were using `ANY()` with UUID arrays without proper type casting.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `delete_warehouse` function in `backend/app.py` where several SQL queries were using:
```sql
WHERE b.location_id = ANY(%s)
WHERE bin_id = ANY(%s)
```

PostgreSQL requires explicit type casting when using `ANY()` with UUID arrays. The correct syntax is:
```sql
WHERE b.location_id = ANY(%s::uuid[])
WHERE bin_id = ANY(%s::uuid[])
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed SQL Queries in `backend/app.py`

**Location**: `delete_warehouse` function (lines 2029-2128)

**Changes Made**:
- **Step 2 Query**: Fixed bin assignment check
  ```sql
  -- Before
  WHERE b.location_id = ANY(%s)
  
  -- After  
  WHERE b.location_id = ANY(%s::uuid[])
  ```

- **Step 3 Query**: Fixed stock count check
  ```sql
  -- Before
  WHERE bin_id = ANY(%s) AND on_hand > 0
  
  -- After
  WHERE bin_id = ANY(%s::uuid[]) AND on_hand > 0
  ```

- **Detailed Stock Query**: Fixed occupied bins details
  ```sql
  -- Before
  WHERE si.bin_id = ANY(%s) AND si.on_hand > 0
  
  -- After
  WHERE si.bin_id = ANY(%s::uuid[]) AND si.on_hand > 0
  ```

- **Bin Update Query**: Fixed setting bins to floating
  ```sql
  -- Before
  WHERE location_id = ANY(%s)
  
  -- After
  WHERE location_id = ANY(%s::uuid[])
  ```

## Testing Results

### Test Case: "Van 2" Warehouse Deletion
- **Warehouse**: Van 2 (ID: f5a4f6ae-004a-4d4e-a890-45c1563e738e, Code: W04)
- **Locations**: 120 locations with old format codes (W04-A1-R01-L1, etc.)
- **Bins**: 16 assigned bins
- **Stock**: 0 stock items (empty warehouse)
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully deleted

### Deletion Process Verified
1. ✅ Found warehouse and 120 locations
2. ✅ Found 16 assigned bins
3. ✅ Confirmed no stock in bins
4. ✅ Set 16 bins to floating (location_id = NULL)
5. ✅ Deleted 120 locations
6. ✅ Deleted 1 warehouse

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Warehouse deletion would fail with PostgreSQL type error
- Users couldn't delete empty warehouses
- Error message: `operator does not exist: uuid = text`

### After Fix
- Warehouse deletion works correctly for empty warehouses
- Proper handling of UUID arrays in PostgreSQL
- Bins are correctly set to floating state
- Locations and warehouse are properly deleted

## Technical Details

### UUID Array Handling
PostgreSQL requires explicit type casting when using `ANY()` with UUID arrays because:
- Python lists are passed as text arrays by default
- UUID columns expect UUID type
- `::uuid[]` cast converts text array to UUID array

### Database Schema Compatibility
The fix works with both:
- **Old location codes**: `W04-A1-R01-L1` (existing data)
- **New location codes**: `A2F10` (future data)

## Files Modified
- `backend/app.py` - Fixed UUID array handling in `delete_warehouse` function

## Verification
The fix was verified by successfully deleting "Van 2" warehouse which had:
- 120 locations with old format codes
- 16 assigned bins
- 0 stock items
- All operations completed successfully

The warehouse deletion logic now works correctly and handles the transition between old and new location code formats seamlessly.

# Warehouse Deletion Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the new warehouse deletion logic that follows the updated data structure where stock items are stored in bins, and bins are assigned to locations within warehouses.

## New Deletion Logic

### Previous Logic (Old)
- Checked for stock items directly in locations
- Used the old schema where `stock_items.location_id` existed
- Simple deletion without considering the bin structure

### New Logic (Implemented)
The new deletion process follows these steps:

1. **Collect all descendant locations** of the warehouse
2. **Find all bins currently assigned** to those locations
3. **Check if those bins contain stock**:
   - If **yes** → abort with a detailed warning (warehouse not empty)
   - If **no** → proceed with deletion
4. **Handle deletion**:
   - Set `bin.location_id = NULL` (bins become "floating")
   - Delete the locations
   - Delete the warehouse

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`backend/app.py`)

#### Updated `delete_warehouse` Function

**Location**: Lines 2029-2068

**Key Changes**:

1. **Step 1: Collect Locations**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, full_code FROM locations 
   WHERE warehouse_id = %s
   ```

2. **Step 2: Find Assigned Bins**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.id, b.code, l.full_code 
   FROM bins b
   JOIN locations l ON b.location_id = l.id
   WHERE b.location_id = ANY(%s)
   ```

3. **Step 3: Check for Stock**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_items 
   WHERE bin_id = ANY(%s) AND on_hand > 0
   ```

4. **Step 4: Detailed Error Reporting**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.code, l.full_code, si.on_hand, p.name
   FROM stock_items si
   JOIN bins b ON si.bin_id = b.id
   JOIN locations l ON b.location_id = l.id
   JOIN products p ON si.product_id = p.id
   WHERE si.bin_id = ANY(%s) AND si.on_hand > 0
   ```

5. **Step 5: Handle Deletion**
   ```sql
   -- Set bins to floating
   UPDATE bins SET location_id = NULL WHERE location_id = ANY(%s)
   
   -- Delete locations
   DELETE FROM locations WHERE warehouse_id = %s
   
   -- Delete warehouse
   DELETE FROM warehouses WHERE id = %s
   ```

## Benefits of New Logic

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- Prevents accidental deletion of warehouses with active stock
- Maintains referential integrity between bins and stock items

### 2. **Detailed Error Messages**
- Shows specific locations and bins that contain stock
- Displays product names and quantities for better user understanding
- Helps users identify what needs to be moved before deletion

### 3. **Graceful Bin Handling**
- Bins become "floating" (available for reassignment) instead of being deleted
- Preserves bin data and allows for future reassignment to other locations
- Maintains bin history and relationships

### 4. **Comprehensive Validation**
- Checks the entire warehouse hierarchy (all descendant locations)
- Validates stock at the bin level (most granular level)
- Provides clear feedback on what prevents deletion

## Error Message Examples

### When Deletion is Blocked
```
Cannot delete warehouse: 5 stock items are still located in this warehouse.

Occupied locations:
• Location A1A1, Bin B001: 10 units of Product A
• Location A1B2, Bin B002: 15 units of Product B
• Location A2C3, Bin B003: 8 units of Product C
```

### When Deletion Succeeds
```
Warehouse deleted successfully! 12 bin(s) are now floating and available for reassignment.
```

## Database Schema Alignment

The new logic correctly aligns with the current database schema:

- **`warehouses`** → **`locations`** → **`bins`** → **`stock_items`**
- Stock items are stored in bins (`stock_items.bin_id`)
- Bins are assigned to locations (`bins.location_id`)
- Locations belong to warehouses (`locations.warehouse_id`)

## Testing Considerations

When testing this functionality:

1. **Test with empty warehouse**: Should delete successfully
2. **Test with warehouse containing floating bins**: Should delete successfully, bins become floating
3. **Test with warehouse containing stock**: Should show detailed error message
4. **Test with warehouse containing multiple products**: Should list all occupied locations
5. **Test permissions**: Should require admin/manager role

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Bulk Stock Movement**: Option to move all stock to another warehouse before deletion
2. **Bin Reassignment**: Automatic reassignment of floating bins to other locations
3. **Deletion Preview**: Show what will be deleted before confirmation
4. **Audit Trail**: Log warehouse deletions for compliance purposes

# Inventory Management System Refactoring Progress

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Break down the monolithic `app.py` (3,564 lines) into a modular, maintainable structure following best practices.

**Current State**: Single `app.py` file with 50+ functions and 40+ routes
**Target State**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns

## Notes
- Keep application functional throughout refactoring
- Test each phase before moving to next
- Maintain git commits for each major change
- Document any issues or decisions made

## Files to Create

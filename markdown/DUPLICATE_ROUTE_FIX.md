# Duplicate Route Fix Summary

## Issue
The application failed to start with the error:
```
AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: products.product_details_modal
```

## Root Cause
There were two identical route definitions in `backend/routes/products.py`:

1. **First definition** (line ~196):
   ```python
   @products_bp.route('/details')
   @login_required
   def product_details_modal():
       """Serve product details modal template"""
       return render_template('product_details_modal.html')
   ```

2. **Duplicate definition** (line ~316):
   ```python
   @products_bp.route('/details')
   @login_required
   def product_details_modal():
       """Serve product details modal template"""
       return render_template('product_details_modal.html')
   ```

## Solution
Removed the duplicate route definition at the end of the file, keeping only the first one.

## Technical Details

### **Flask Route Registration**
Flask doesn't allow multiple routes with the same endpoint name within the same blueprint. When it encounters a duplicate, it throws an `AssertionError` because it would overwrite the existing endpoint function.

### **Blueprint Structure**
The route structure is now clean:
- `GET /products/details` → Serves the product details modal template
- `GET /products/api/{product_id}/details` → Returns JSON product details

## Fix Applied

### **Before (Duplicate Routes)**
```python
# First definition (kept)
@products_bp.route('/details')
@login_required
def product_details_modal():
    """Serve product details modal template"""
    return render_template('product_details_modal.html')

# ... other routes ...

# Duplicate definition (removed)
@products_bp.route('/details')
@login_required
def product_details_modal():
    """Serve product details modal template"""
    return render_template('product_details_modal.html')
```

### **After (Single Route)**
```python
# Only definition (kept)
@products_bp.route('/details')
@login_required
def product_details_modal():
    """Serve product details modal template"""
    return render_template('product_details_modal.html')

# ... other routes ...
# (duplicate removed)
```

## Testing

### **Application Startup**
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ No duplicate route warnings
- ✅ All blueprints register successfully

### **Product Details Modal**
- ✅ Modal template route works (`/products/details`)
- ✅ Product details API route works (`/products/api/{id}/details`)
- ✅ JavaScript can fetch modal content
- ✅ JavaScript can fetch product details

## Prevention

### **Best Practices**
1. **Code Review**: Always review route definitions for duplicates
2. **IDE Support**: Use IDE features to detect duplicate function names
3. **Testing**: Test application startup after adding new routes
4. **Documentation**: Keep route documentation up to date

### **Development Workflow**
1. Add new routes at the end of the file
2. Test application startup immediately
3. Check for any duplicate route names
4. Verify all routes are accessible

## Related Files

### **Modified Files**
- `backend/routes/products.py` - Removed duplicate route definition

### **Affected Functionality**
- Product Details Modal (now working properly)
- Application startup (no longer fails)

## Conclusion

The duplicate route issue has been resolved. The application now:
- Starts successfully without errors
- Has clean, non-duplicate route definitions
- Maintains all functionality for the product details modal
- Follows Flask best practices for route registration

This fix ensures the application is stable and all features work as expected.

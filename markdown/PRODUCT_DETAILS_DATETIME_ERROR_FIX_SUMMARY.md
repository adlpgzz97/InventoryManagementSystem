# Product Details Modal - Datetime Error Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The Product Details modal was returning a 404 error for specific products like "Laboratory Ethanol" with the error message:
```
"unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.date' and 'datetime.datetime'"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified through systematic debugging:

1. **Product Existence Confirmed**: The product `7fbadf57-b5de-43b1-a174-6d6cb7c4cd51` ("Laboratory Ethanol") exists in the database
2. **Authentication Issue Identified**: Initially, the API was returning HTML (login page) instead of JSON due to missing authentication
3. **Datetime Comparison Error**: After authentication was resolved, the real issue was a datetime comparison error in the `StockItem` model

## Technical Details

### The Error Location
The error occurred in `backend/models/stock.py` in two methods:

1. **`days_until_expiry()` method** (line 275):
   ```python
   # BEFORE (causing error):
   delta = self.expiry_date - datetime.now()
   
   # AFTER (fixed):
   delta = self.expiry_date - datetime.now().date()
   ```

2. **`is_expired()` method** (line 265):
   ```python
   # BEFORE (causing error):
   return datetime.now() > self.expiry_date
   
   # AFTER (fixed):
   return datetime.now().date() > self.expiry_date
   ```

### Why This Happened
- Database `expiry_date` field is stored as `DATE` type (returns `datetime.date` objects)
- `datetime.now()` returns a `datetime.datetime` object
- Python doesn't allow arithmetic operations between `date` and `datetime` objects
- The `get_product_details` method calls `days_until_expiry()` for expiring items, triggering the error

## Solution Applied
Fixed the datetime comparison by converting `datetime.now()` to a `date` object using `.date()` method, ensuring both operands are of the same type.

## Testing Results
After the fix:
- ✅ API endpoint returns 200 status code
- ✅ JSON response contains complete product details
- ✅ "Laboratory Ethanol" product details load successfully
- ✅ All datetime calculations work correctly

## Files Modified
- `backend/models/stock.py`: Fixed datetime comparison in `days_until_expiry()` and `is_expired()` methods

## Impact
This fix resolves the 404 error for products with expiry dates, allowing the Product Details modal to work correctly for all products in the system.

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always ensure consistent datetime types when performing comparisons
- Use `.date()` when comparing with DATE database fields
- Add type checking for datetime operations in critical paths

# Schema Migration Plan: Implementing New Inventory Database Schema

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement the revised inventory database schema that introduces cleaner separation of concerns for products, suppliers, stock, and forecasting. The key change is moving forecasting fields from the `products` table to a new `replenishment_policies` table.

## âœ… COMPLETED PHASES

### âœ… Phase 1: Database Schema Migration - COMPLETED

#### âœ… Step 1.1: Create New Tables - COMPLETED
- [x] Created `replenishment_policies` table
- [x] Created `suppliers` table  
- [x] Created `product_suppliers` table
- [x] Added appropriate indexes for performance

#### âœ… Step 1.2: Migrate Existing Forecasting Data - COMPLETED
- [x] Migrated existing forecasting data from products to replenishment_policies
- [x] Created default policies for products without forecasting data
- [x] Verified data migration (17 replenishment policies created)

#### âœ… Step 1.3: Remove Forecasting Columns from Products - COMPLETED
- [x] Removed forecasting columns from products table
- [x] Verified column removal

### âœ… Phase 2: Backend Code Updates - COMPLETED

#### âœ… Step 2.1: Update Flask Application (`backend/app.py`) - COMPLETED
- [x] Updated products listing query to include replenishment policies
- [x] Updated product details API to include replenishment policies
- [x] Updated forecasting API endpoint to work with new replenishment_policies table
- [x] Added comprehensive supplier management API endpoints:
  - [x] GET /api/suppliers - Get all suppliers
  - [x] POST /api/suppliers - Create new supplier
  - [x] PUT /api/suppliers/<id> - Update supplier
  - [x] DELETE /api/suppliers/<id> - Delete supplier
  - [x] GET /api/product/<id>/suppliers - Get product suppliers
  - [x] POST /api/product/<id>/suppliers - Add supplier to product
  - [x] DELETE /api/product-supplier/<id> - Remove supplier from product
- [x] Added suppliers route to Flask app

### âœ… Phase 3: Frontend Template Updates - COMPLETED

#### âœ… Step 3.1: Create Supplier Management Templates - COMPLETED
- [x] Created `backend/views/suppliers.html` with full CRUD functionality
- [x] Added search and filtering capabilities
- [x] Added sortable columns
- [x] Added responsive design with Bootstrap

#### âœ… Step 3.2: Update Navigation - COMPLETED
- [x] Updated navigation menu in `backend/views/base.html`
- [x] Activated suppliers link (removed "Coming Soon" status)

#### âœ… Step 3.3: Verify Existing Templates - COMPLETED
- [x] Verified products template works with new schema
- [x] Confirmed forecasting functionality remains intact
- [x] Tested application imports successfully

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### Database Changes
- **New Tables Created**: 3
  - `replenishment_policies` - Stores forecasting settings
  - `suppliers` - Stores supplier master data
  - `product_suppliers` - Many-to-many relationship between products and suppliers
- **Data Migrated**: 17 replenishment policies
- **Indexes Created**: 3 performance indexes

### Backend Changes
- **API Endpoints Added**: 7 new supplier management endpoints

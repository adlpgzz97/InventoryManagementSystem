# Warehouse Stock Filtering Fix

## Issue
When clicking "View Stock" for a warehouse, the stock page correctly navigated to `/stock?warehouse={{ warehouse.id }}` but the stock items were not filtered by the selected warehouse.

## Root Cause
The warehouse filtering system had several issues:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The `get_all_with_locations()` method in `StockItem` model didn't include warehouse IDs, only warehouse names
2. **Filter Logic Mismatch**: The warehouse filter dropdown was populated with warehouse names, but the URL parameter passed warehouse IDs
3. **JavaScript Filter Logic**: The filter logic was trying to match warehouse names instead of warehouse IDs

## Solution

### 1. **Enhanced StockItem Model**
**File**: `backend/models/stock.py`

**Updated Method**: `get_all_with_locations()`
- Added `warehouse_id` to the SQL query
- Added `warehouse_id` to the returned data structure
- Now returns both warehouse ID and name for proper filtering

**Key Changes**:
```sql
-- Added warehouse_id to SELECT statement
w.id as warehouse_id, w.name as warehouse_name, w.code as warehouse_code
```

```python
# Added warehouse_id to returned data
'warehouse_id': result['warehouse_id']
```

### 2. **Updated Stock Route**
**File**: `backend/routes/stock.py`

**Enhanced Route**: `stock_list()`
- Added support for `warehouse` query parameter
- Filters stock items by warehouse ID when parameter is provided
- Passes warehouse information to template for pre-selection

**Key Changes**:
```python
warehouse_id = request.args.get('warehouse', '')
# Filter by warehouse if parameter provided
elif warehouse_id:
    stock_items = StockItem.get_all_with_locations()
    stock_items = [item for item in stock_items if item.get('warehouse_id') == warehouse_id]
```

### 3. **Updated Stock Template**
**File**: `backend/views/stock.html`

**Enhanced Warehouse Filter Dropdown**:
- Changed from warehouse names to warehouse IDs as option values
- Updated pre-selection logic to use warehouse IDs
- Maintains warehouse names as display text

**Key Changes**:
```html
<!-- Changed from warehouse names to warehouse IDs -->
<option value="{{ warehouse_id }}" {% if selected_warehouse and selected_warehouse == warehouse_id %}selected{% endif %}>{{ warehouse_name }}</option>
```

### 4. **Updated JavaScript Filter Logic**
**File**: `backend/views/stock.html`

**Enhanced Filter Function**: `filterStock()`
- Updated warehouse matching logic to use exact warehouse ID matching
- Simplified from complex string matching to direct ID comparison

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Changed from complex string matching to exact ID matching
const matchesBin = !warehouseTerm || warehouse === warehouseTerm;
```

### 5. **Updated Base Template**
**File**: `backend/views/base.html`

**Enhanced URL Parameter Handling**: `restoreStockFilters()`
- Now properly sets warehouse filter dropdown when warehouse ID is in URL
- Maintains existing functionality for other filter parameters

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **User clicks "View Stock"** → Navigates to `/stock?warehouse={{ warehouse.id }}`
2. **Backend receives request** → Extracts warehouse ID from query parameters
3. **Database query** → Filters stock items by warehouse ID
4. **Template rendering** → Pre-selects warehouse in dropdown
5. **JavaScript initialization** → Applies filters and updates display

### Filter Logic
- **Warehouse Filter**: Exact warehouse ID matching
- **Search Filter**: Text search across product, SKU, bin, location
- **Status Filter**: Stock status (out, low, in)
- **Low Stock Filter**: Items with available stock < 10

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Immediate Filtering**: Stock items are automatically filtered when clicking "View Stock"
- **Visual Feedback**: Warehouse filter dropdown shows the selected warehouse
- **Consistent Experience**: Filter state is preserved in URL parameters
- **Easy Navigation**: Can easily switch between warehouses or clear filters

### For System
- **Data Integrity**: Uses warehouse IDs for reliable filtering
- **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple warehouses without performance degradation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between backend and frontend

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Warehouse Selection**: Click "View Stock" on any warehouse card
2. **Filter Persistence**: Refresh page with warehouse parameter
3. **Filter Clearing**: Use "Clear" button to reset all filters
4. **Multiple Filters**: Combine warehouse filter with search and status filters
5. **URL Sharing**: Share filtered stock page URL with others

### Expected Behavior
- Stock items should be filtered to show only items from the selected warehouse
- Warehouse filter dropdown should show the selected warehouse
- URL should contain the warehouse parameter
- All other filtering functionality should continue to work

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Add warehouse name to page breadcrumbs
2. **Warehouse Summary**: Show warehouse-specific statistics
3. **Export Filtering**: Export only filtered stock items
4. **Bulk Operations**: Apply bulk operations to filtered items only
5. **Real-time Updates**: Update stock counts in real-time

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Dashboard Integration**: Link warehouse stock views to dashboard
2. **Reporting**: Generate warehouse-specific stock reports
3. **Alerts**: Set up low stock alerts per warehouse
4. **Analytics**: Track warehouse utilization and performance

## Conclusion

The warehouse stock filtering fix provides a seamless user experience when viewing stock for specific warehouses. The implementation ensures data integrity, performance, and maintainability while providing immediate value to users through automatic filtering and visual feedback.

The solution addresses the core issue of mismatched data types and provides a robust foundation for future warehouse-specific features and enhancements.

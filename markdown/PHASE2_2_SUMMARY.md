## Service Composition Patterns

### **1. Dependency Injection**
```python
class ServiceOrchestrator(BaseService):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.warehouse_service = WarehouseService()
        self.product_service = ProductService()
        self.stock_service = StockService()
        self.transaction_service = TransactionService()
        self.scanner_service = ScannerService()
```

### **2. Service Coordination**
```python
def perform_stock_transfer(self, source_bin_id, target_bin_id, product_id, quantity, user_id):
    # Coordinate multiple services for complex operation
    source_stock = self.stock_service.get_stock_by_bin_and_product(source_bin_id, product_id)
    target_bin = self.warehouse_service.get_bin_stock(target_bin_id)
    outbound_transaction = self.transaction_service.create_transaction(...)
    inbound_transaction = self.transaction_service.create_transaction(...)
```

### **3. Transaction Management**
```python
def rollback_operation(self, operation_id, user_id, reason):
    # Get audit trail from transaction service
    audit_trail = self.transaction_service.get_transaction_audit_trail(operation_id)
    
    # Reverse transactions in reverse order
    for transaction in reversed(audit_trail):
        reversed_transaction = self.transaction_service.reverse_transaction(...)
```

## Architecture Benefits

### **1. **Service Composition**
- Complex operations coordinated across multiple services
- Business logic encapsulated in appropriate service layers
- Reduced coupling between different business domains

### **2. **Transaction Management**
- Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
- Rollback capabilities for complex operations
- Transaction consistency across service boundaries

### **3. **Scalability**
- New business processes can be added as new orchestration methods
- Services can be extended independently
- Complex operations can be broken down into manageable pieces

### **4. **Maintainability**
- Business logic centralized in appropriate services
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to modify individual service behaviors

## Code Quality Improvements

### **Before Phase 2.2**
- Routes contained complex business logic
- No service composition patterns
- Limited transaction management
- No rollback capabilities

### **After Phase 2.2**
- All business logic moved to services
- Service composition patterns implemented
- Comprehensive transaction management
- Full rollback and audit capabilities
